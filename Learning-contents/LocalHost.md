**LOCALHOST**

**What is `localhost`?**

* **`localhost` \= Your own computer.**  
* **It is a hostname (just like `www.google.com`), but it always refers to your current machine.**  
* **It uses the IP address `127.0.0.1` (for IPv4) or `::1` (for IPv6).**  
* **When you type `http://localhost:3000`, it means:**  
  **“Hey computer, talk to yourself on port 3000.”**


# **What is the `127.0.0.1` IP?**

* **It's a loopback address → sends traffic from your computer to itself.**  
* **Even without the internet, your computer can talk to itself using this.**
